# SPINAS

SPINAS (Spinor Amplitudes) is a software package for calculating constructive scattering amplitudes.

## Prerequisites

SPINAS requires:
* CMake (version 3.5 or higher)
* C++ compiler
* Boost (version 1.71 or higher)

## Unix-like Systems (Linux, macOS, WSL, Cygwin, etc.)

### Compilation

To compile and install SPINAS, open a terminal and follow these steps:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j10
```

### Running Tests

After installation, you can run the provided tests:
```
./test_spinas
./test_SM
```

### Installation

If you would like to install the libraries, you can run:
```
sudo make install
```

You can specify a custom install location by setting the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/location ..
make install
```

Replace `/path/to/install/location` with your desired installation directory.

##Windows

### Compilation

For native Windows compilation, you need to have CMake and a compiler (like Visual Studio) installed.

Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to your project directory, then follow these steps:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Running Tests

After installation, you can run the provided tests:
```
test_spinas.exe
test_SM.exe
```

### Installation

If you would like to install the libraries, you can run:
```
cmake --install .
```

You can specify a custom install location by setting the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\path\to\install\location ..
cmake --install .
```

Replace `C:\path\to\install\location` with your desired installation directory.

## Usage

### Including SPINAS in your project

To use SPINAS in your project, include the `spinas.h` header file in your source code:
```
#include <spinas/spinas.h>
```

Then, when compiling your project, link against the SPINAS library. The name of the library
is libspinas.so on Unix-like systems and spinas.lib on Windows. If you installed SPINAS in
a non-default location, make sure to tell your compiler where to find the headers and the
library file. For example, if you're using GCC, you can do this:
```
g++ -I/path/to/spinas/include -L/path/to/spinas/lib -lspinas your_source_file.cpp
```

Replace /path/to/spinas with the location where you installed SPINAS. On Windows, you would
modify the include and library directories in your project settings if you're using an IDE
like Visual Studio.

## Examples

For examples of how to use this library, see the SM directory, where some SM processes are
calculated using the library and don't forget to read the manual.
